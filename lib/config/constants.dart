The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of Cicero\'s De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:\n“Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.”\nThe purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that doesn\'t distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.\nThe passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it\'s seen all around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs.
